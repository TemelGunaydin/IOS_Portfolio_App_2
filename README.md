# iOS Learning App

This project is an iOS application built using **SwiftUI** for learning purposes. The main focus is on understanding the basics of SwiftUI, and it currently contains several views showcasing core SwiftUI components. In the future, network calls will be added to enhance the app's functionality.

## Features

- **SwiftUI Views**: Basic views that demonstrate SwiftUI components like Text, Buttons, Lists, Stacks, etc.
- **Modular Design**: Views are structured in a modular way for easier understanding and scalability.
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Implementing network calls.
  - Adding more complex UI elements.
